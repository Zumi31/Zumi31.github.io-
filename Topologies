Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation tool for practicing simple and complex networks. It offers two workspaces:

- **Logical Workspace:** Shows the logical layout of a network, including connections between virtual devices.
- **Physical Workspace:** Provides a graphical representation of physical networks, showcasing layouts and connections in real environments.

### Network Topologies&#x20;

### TOPOLOGY: The arrangement of a network that comprises nodes and connecting lines via senderÂ and receiver

#### 1. **Bus Topology**

- **Description:** All devices connect to a single central cable (backbone). Data flows in one direction.
- **Advantages:**
  - Minimal cabling is needed.
  - Cost-effective for small networks.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - If the backbone fails, the entire network crashes.
  - High network traffic increases collisions.
- **Steps to Simulate:**
  - Use four devices (PCs) and switches.
  - Connect devices with copper crossover cables.
  - Assign IP addresses and test data transfer.

#### 2. **Star Topology**

- **Description:** Devices connect to a central hub. The hub acts as the central point for communication.
- **Advantages:**
  - Simple to set up and expand.
  - Minimal ports required on each device.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Failure of the hub affects the entire network.
  - Installation is costly.
- **Steps to Simulate:**
  - Use four devices and one switch.
  - Connect devices to the switch.
  - Assign IP addresses and verify connections.

#### 3. **Mesh Topology**

- **Description:** Every device connects to every other device through dedicated links.
- **Advantages:**
  - Robust and secure.
  - Easy to identify and fix faults.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Expensive due to extensive cabling.
  - Installation and maintenance are challenging.
- **Steps to Simulate:**
  - Connect all devices using multiple links.
  - Assign IPs to all devices and test communication.

---

#### 4. **Ring Topology**

- **Description:** Devices form a ring, with each device connecting to two neighbors.
- **Advantages:**
  - Minimal collisions.
  - Inexpensive to install.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Troubleshooting is complex.
  - Adding or removing devices disturbs the network.
- **Steps to Simulate:**
  - Connect devices in a circular layout using copper crossover cables.
  - Assign IP addresses and test data transfer.

### Result

The manual concludes that simulating network topologies like bus, star, mesh, and ring using Packet Tracer is successfully achieved.
