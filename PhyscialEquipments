Network Devices: Network devices, also known as networking hardware, are physical devices that
allow hardware on a computer network to communicate and interact with one another.
For example Repeater, Hub, Bridge, Switch, Routers,
### **1. Repeaters**
Repeaters are physical layer devices in the OSI model designed to amplify or regenerate signals to extend a network's coverage. Types include:
- **Analog Repeaters:** Amplify analog signals.
- **Digital Repeaters:** Reconstruct distorted signals.
- **Wired Repeaters:** Used in LANs.
- **Wireless Repeaters:** Used in wireless networks.

**Advantages:**
- Cost-effective and easy to install.
- Extends network coverage.
- Can connect using different cables.

**Disadvantages:**
- Cannot connect dissimilar networks.
- Does not filter out noise.
- Limited deployment capacity.

### **2. Hubs**
A hub is a physical layer device that connects multiple devices in a LAN. Types include:
- **Passive Hubs:** Act as simple connectors.
- **Active Hubs:** Function as repeaters with added functionality.
- **Intelligent Hubs:** Provide advanced management and switching features.

### **3. Bridges**
Bridges operate at both the physical and data link layers. They filter frames based on MAC addresses and decide whether to forward or drop them.  
Types:
- **Transparent Bridges:** Do not require reconfiguration upon addition or removal.
- **Source Routing Bridges:** Source station specifies the route for data.

### **4. Routers**
Routers work at the network layer and forward data packets based on their logical addresses. They are equipped with dynamic routing tables and support host-to-host communication.  
Types:
- **Wireless Routers:** Provide Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections.
- **Broadband Routers:** Offer internet access and VoIP technology.
- **Core Routers:** Link devices within a network.
- **Edge Routers:** Connect internal to external networks.

### **5. Gateways**
Gateways serve as a passage between different networks, functioning across any OSI layer. They handle protocol conversions and manage routing paths.  
Types:
- **Network Gateways:** Interface between two dissimilar networks.
- **Cloud Storage Gateways:** Translate storage requests to cloud services.
- **IoT Gateways:** Connect IoT devices to networks.
- **VoIP Trunk Gateways:** Link traditional telephony with VoIP.

### **6. Switches**
Switches are data link layer devices that connect devices within a network and direct data based on MAC addresses.  
Types:
- **Unmanaged Switches:** Plug-and-play devices for home networks.
- **Managed Switches:** Customizable for large networks, offering advanced features.
- **LAN Switches:** Reduce network congestion.
- **PoE Switches:** Combine power and data transmission.

---

### **7. Modems**
Modems are devices that convert digital signals into analog for transmission over mediums like telephone lines.  
Types:
- **Simplex Modem:** One-way data transmission.
- **Half-Duplex Modem:** Two-way data, but one direction at a time.
- **Full-Duplex Modem:** Simultaneous two-way data transmission.
